#M-Math 
An app that sharpens your mental math abilities, progressing form simple single digit addition to more complex arithmatic and in future editions algebra and calculus

##Usage
1. Run the script using groovy m-math.groovy
2. Login or signup
3. Start a lesson
5. Follow the rules/instructions for lesson
4. Once a lesson is complete you are done for the day come back the next day to continue sharpening your skills
##How it works
###A quick preface on having quick mental math skills
No one is born being good at math. Being good at math is not genetic, it isnt some magic talent bestowed on you by genetics. All it takes is practice. The thing is though
few of us have a strong foundation and we have not improved our internal calculators to their optimum levels. That is why this app starts at the very begining with single digit addition and does not progress until it becomes so engrained it becomes second nature. 

###Slow repeated steps
There are 2 things that this app attempts to teach the user. The first is precision, the second being speed. If you make a mistake that problem will show up again and again until you have it down for example let's say you are in the multiplication level and are asked 4 * 13 and you put in 62. Once the lesson is complete you are going to have to go through the incorrect answers and correct them. If in the lesson overall you got bellow 90% you will redo the lesson.

This might seem tedious but by repeating and by constant drilling eventaully your brain will make connections and pathways that will become more and more easy to use. You will eventually not even think through the problem it will have become second nature.

The other important aspect is the time constraints on a lesson. The maximum time for working through a lesson should be at most 15 minutes. Including the time to work through corrections it should not take more then 30 minutes. The reasoning behind this is two fold. One being you are a human not a calculator you have a life. Spending hours doing mental math is not helping anyone. The second being that mental math is hard on the brain. It can be exhausting. Hence why the lessons are short, we push the brain a little bit each ttime, progressing through more complex problems. But never reaching a point where you can't handle it.
##Why is this important
Remember in school when they told you that you would not always have a calculator in your hand. Well now with smart phones everyone does. So you would think this isnt important at all. And it's true you dont need to be good at mental math in our modern era. But, the benefits far outwheigh the costs of spending 20 minutes a day working on your math skills. There has been a huge rise in brain training apps that have little games that test your memory and quickness. They ask you to match patterns of shapes and other puzzles. But the thing is those apps have not been proven to make you any smarter. On the other hand practicing math does make you smarter. It sharpens your brain, much like reading or learning a foriegn language do.
